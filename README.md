# Getting Started with this project

This project was developed as the second project for Senior Front End Engineer - OLX Scholarship.

It's a poll app that let a employee to view and answer polls. In order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, you have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered.

The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.
